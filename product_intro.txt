Product Introduction – Puffin

What is Puffin?
----------------
Puffin is a teacher-centered AI platform that transforms unstructured teacher voice inputs into structured, actionable educational feedback. Teachers can use Puffin to record reflections—about student work, classroom progress, or development talks—and receive polished feedback drafts that can be copied into their existing channels like LMS platforms, emails, or PDF reports.

Value Proposition
-----------------
- **Build on what you do** – use voice, not typing.
- **Immediate relevance** – capture insights while they’re fresh.
- **Teacher-first control** – you write, we draft; you edit and approve.
- **Plug-and-play integration** – works alongside systems you already use.

Data Entry Workspace
---------------------
Teachers manage their feedback entries in a clean, filterable dashboard. Each entry is its own row, enabling quick filtering, reviewing, and action. Clicking a row opens a detailed page where the transcript, AI-draft, and metadata are presented for editing and export.

**Table column structure (per row):**
- Unique entry ID
- Optional student first name
- Custom entry label or identifier (editable)
- Date/time created
- Audio duration (e.g. “2:34”)
- Type: Assessment | Short-Cycle Note | Development Memo
- Button to “View transcript”
- Delete icon (with “Are you sure?” confirmation)

**Table features:**
- **Sortable columns** (date, name, type)
- **Search and filter**: by student, type, or date range
- **Responsive behavior**: row density settings, sticky headers, and horizontal scroll for tables on tablets or desktops
- **Hover or click state**: indicates row is clickable and opens detail view

Best Practice Guidelines (based on UX research):
- Tables support four core user actions: find, compare, view/edit, take action.
