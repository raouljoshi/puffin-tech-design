System/Role

You are building a responsive landing page for Puffin—an AI assistant that turns teachers’ natural voice reflections into structured, age-appropriate formative feedback. The page must persuade school leaders (decision-makers) and teachers (users), balancing effectiveness (better learning impact) with efficiency (time saved).

⸻

Brand & Voice
	•	Tone: warm, teacher-first, evidence-informed, practical, privacy-forward.
	•	Positioning: “Work smarter, not harder” for formative assessment.
	•	Tagline idea: Teacher talks, AI writes.
	•	Key message: Puffin converts unstructured teacher input into structured feedback so no teachable moment slips through the cracks.

⸻

Audience & Jobs-to-be-Done
	•	School leaders: consistency, quality assurance, privacy compliance, early intervention signal, responsible AI.
	•	Teachers: less admin, faster high-quality feedback, keeps their voice, fits existing workflows.
	•	Student support: common source of truth; early risk/protective factor visibility.

⸻

Must-include Concepts/Quotes (use as callouts or microcopy)
	•	“Teacher talks, AI writes.”
	•	“Capture it when it’s fresh.” (short-cycle, immediate observations)
	•	“Scaffolding voice input with AI” → transcribe + structure + summarize into actionable feedback.
	•	“Teachers should be selective… key observations are worth documenting.”
	•	“Converting unstructured input into structured feedback ensures no teachable moment slips through the cracks and builds a dataset for reflection.”
	•	“Work smarter, not harder.”
	•	Dylan Wiliam: “Good feedback works towards its own redundancy” (students become self-regulating over time).

Page Structure & Content Spec

1) Hero (above the fold)
	•	H1: Teacher talks, AI writes.
	•	Subhead (1–2 lines): Turn natural voice reflections into structured, motivating feedback—without new workflows. Capture short-cycle notes, assignment feedback, and termly development memos in minutes.
	•	Primary CTA: Get the demo (2 min)
	•	Secondary CTA: Join the pilot (leaders) / Try it for my class (teachers)
	•	Visual: short loop/video: tap-to-record → transcript streaming → structured output preview.
	•	Trust chips: GDPR-first • No audio stored • Teacher-in-control drafts • Exports to your system (e.g., Unikum, Prorenata, Infomentor)

2) The Problem → The Better Way
	•	Section title: Running faster is not the goal—running in the right direction is.
	•	Copy:
	•	Today: insights live in teachers’ heads or get lost in paperwork; development talks are infrequent; daily feedback is inconsistent or undocumented.
	•	Puffin: captures it when it’s fresh, then structures it with research-backed patterns—efficiency + effectiveness.
	•	Mini-stats row (use placeholders):
	•	Minutes to draft vs. hours of typing
	•	% of memos accepted with minimal edits
	•	Weekly active teachers in pilot

3) How Puffin Works (3 steps)
	•	Step 1 – Record: One-tap, speak naturally. Switch purpose mid-record (Assessment / Notes / Developmental reviews).
	•	Step 2 – Review: Add first name, grade level, language. Confirm → Generate draft. (Cancel = hard delete.)
	•	Step 3 – Receive: Age-appropriate, purpose-specific drafts in minutes. Copy, edit, or export.

Pull-quote: “Teachers should be selective—Puffin helps document the key observations that matter.”

4) What You Can Create (by “purpose”)

Purpose 1: Assessments (formative feedback on student work assignments)  
Purpose 2: Notes (structured short‑cycle reflections)  
Purpose 3: Developmental reviews (long‑cycle periodical reports)

Use a 3-card layout with nested bullets + sample screenshots (use placeholder images).
	•	Short-cycle notes (daily/weekly):
	•	Summary of recent observations (academic + SEL); optional early-warning flags.
	•	Callout: “Capture it when it’s fresh.”
	•	Assignment / student-work feedback:
	•	Criteria-linked strengths, improvements, next steps; teacher’s voice preserved.
	•	Long-cycle assessments (development-talk prep):
	•	Strength-based memo + subject reviews; optional appendix for extra examples.

5) Evidence & Design Philosophy
	•	Title: Feedback that’s both useful and usable
	•	Bullets:
	•	Research places feedback among the highest-impact practices when it is timely, specific, and actionable.
	•	Scaffolding voice with AI ensures tone stays human while structure stays clear.
	•	Wiliam’s principle: good feedback leads to self-regulation → we nudge student agency over time.
	•	Quote rail: “Work smarter, not harder.” / “Good feedback works towards its own redundancy.”

6) Benefits by Stakeholder
	•	Teachers: Hours saved, consistent quality, fewer after-hours admin tasks.
	•	School leaders: Cross-class consistency, better prep for talks, privacy-by-design, early signals without extra meetings.
	•	Parents & students: Clear, motivating take-home guidance in the right tone and reading/listening level.
	•	Student Health (Elevhälsan): A common source of truth to surface risk/protective factors earlier (opt-in).

7) Privacy & Responsible AI (trust section)
	•	GDPR-first: No audio or identifiers stored by default; cancel = delete.
	•	Human-in-the-loop: Outputs are drafts for teacher approval; teachers stay in control.
	•	Data minimization: First name, grade band, language; retention only if the school opts in.
	•	Integrations (opt-in): Export to existing platforms; integrations added if schools want them.

8) See It in Action (demo)
	•	Embed a 2-minute video (hero CTA anchors here).
	•	Provide downloadable sample outputs (PDF): Short-cycle note, Assignment feedback, Development memo.

9) Quick Start (for teachers)
	•		1.	Tap Record → speak naturally.
	•		2.	Confirm & Save + Analyze.
	•		3.	Review, edit, export to your system.
	•	Tip list: be specific, mix strengths & next steps, tag SEL when relevant.

10) FAQs
	•	Do you store audio? → By default, no. Cancel = delete; confirm = analyze; retention only if school opts in.
	•	How do you handle languages? → Output language selectable; tone and reading level adapt to grade band.
	•	Will this replace our talk workflow? → No. Puffin plugs into your existing processes.
	•	Can we integrate with our LMS? → Exports work today; we’ll integrate with systems you already use if the pilot is successful.
	•	What about student health workflows? → Optional tagging/flags can support Elevhälsan without surveillance.

11) Final CTA Block
	•	Leaders: Book a 15-min intro (calendar).
	•	Teachers: Try a guided demo (sandbox).
	•	Secondary: Join the pilot (form).
